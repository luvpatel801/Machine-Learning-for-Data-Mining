# Machine-Learning-for-Data-Mining
This repository is specifically created for my Machine Learning for Data Mining course at DAIICT where we were given practical assignments in Lab each week to work upon. I created a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras for MNIST and CIFAR-100 Dataset Classication. Implemented pre-processing functions (Normalization, One-Hot coding, Data Splitting) and compared loss and accuracy for each CNN model with diï¬€erent optimizers(SGD, Adam) and activation functions(Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLu). My role was to build the classification model using Keras of CNN, to model the Network through Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis and to output validation loss/accuracy figures and matrices for each possible architecture.
